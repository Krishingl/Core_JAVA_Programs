/*
 * 
 * OutPut : Bike Has a Horn. Bike Is running. Car Is Having Horn. Car Is
 * running. -------now its ok but i want to add car inside one feature then if
 * added inside the interface then its a kind of boundation because if we write
 * inside interface digitalMetter() then its forceing the all implimeter classes
 * you mast be override this method if not override then your abstract class. in
 * over mind then one idea is there its a comman method then we can directly
 * write inside the Car class but if we Write inside Car class directly then its
 * not visible to end-user its not showing on the user Interface thats problem
 * Before java 8 Version.
